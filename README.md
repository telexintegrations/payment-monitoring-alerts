# 🏦 Payment Monitoring & Alerts
🚀 An Output Integration for Telex that monitors failed payments, chargebacks, and revenue updates from Flutterwave, and Paystack. It sends alerts via Telex, Slack, and Email to notify business owners of important transaction issues.

## 📌 Project Overview
The Payment Monitoring & Alerts integration listens to webhook events from payment gateways. When a failed payment, chargeback, or revenue update occurs, it triggers alerts via:
✅ Telex
✅ Slack
✅ Email

This helps businesses stay informed and act quickly on payment issues.

npm install
```

🔹 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root folder and add the required keys:
```sh

## 🏗 How to Use the Integration
1️⃣ Register your webhook URL with Paystack, or Flutterwave.

3️⃣ The integration will automatically listen for webhook events.
4️⃣ When an event occurs, alerts will be sent to Telex, Slack, and Email.

## 🔍 How to Test the Integration

1. Test Webhooks with Postman

Manually trigger a test event by sending a POST request to the webhook URL:

POST https://payment-monitoring-alerts.onrender.com/webhook
Content-Type: application/json

Payload:
```sh
{
  "status": "failed",
  "reference": "txn_123456",
  "user": "dainty@gmail.com",
  "amount": 5000,
  "currency": "NGN",
  "reason": "Expired card"
}
```

2. Test Webhooks from Telex

1️⃣ Go to Telex Dashboard
- Navigate to Integrations → Logs
- Find Payment Monitoring & Alerts

2️⃣ Trigger a Test Event

Click Send Test Event
If Telex is correctly set up, alerts should be sent to:
✅ Telex notifications in the #payment-monitoring-alert channel
✅ Slack (if configured)
✅ Email (if configured)

3️⃣ If No Alerts Appear in Telex

Instead, manually trigger a test using Postman:

Send a POST request to https://payment-monitoring-alerts.onrender.com/webhook with this JSON payload:
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "reference": "txn_123456",
  "user": "dainty@gmail.com",
  "amount": 5000,
  "currency": "NGN",
  "reason": "Expired card"
}
```

4️⃣ Check Logs for Errors

- Review your server logs (on Render)
- Check Telex’s Failed Requests logs
